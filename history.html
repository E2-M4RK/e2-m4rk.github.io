                                London is the capital of England and the United Kingdom and one of the largest and most
                                important cities in the world.
                                The area was originally settled by early hunter gatherers around 6,000 B.C., and
                                researchers have found evidence of Bronze Age bridges
                                and Iron Age forts near the River Thames.<br><br>

                                Ancient Romans founded a port and trading settlement called Londinium in 43 A.D., and a
                                few years later a bridge was constructed across
                                the Thames to facilitate commerce and troop movements. But in 60 A.D., Celtic queen
                                Boudicca led an army to sack the city, which was burned
                                to the ground in the first of many fires to destroy London.<br><br>

                                The city was soon rebuilt, but burned again about 125 A.D. More rebuilding occurred, and
                                within a few generations the population exceeded
                                40,000 people. After the fall of the Roman Empire in 476 A.D., however, the city was
                                attacked numerous times by Vikings and other raiders,
                                and soon London was largely abandoned.<br><br>

                                The city’s fortunes began to change in 1065, when Westminster Abbey was established. One
                                year later, after his victory at the Battle of
                                Hastings, William the Conqueror was crowned King of England. During his reign, the Tower
                                of London was built, and in 1176 a wooden London
                                Bridge that had repeatedly burned was replaced by a bridge of stone.

                                As the power of the Tudor and the Stuart dynasties grew, London expanded in size and
                                importance. By the time Henry VIII was king, the population of London was at least
                                100,000.<br><br>

                                Tensions between Protestants and Catholics, however, darkened the otherwise prosperous
                                reign of Henry’s daughter, Elizabeth I. In 1605, Catholic sympathizer Guy Fawkes
                                tried—and failed—to blow up the entire British House of Parliament in the infamous
                                Gunpowder Plot.<br><br>

                                Real disaster struck in 1665, when London was hit by the Great Plague, which killed
                                about 100,000 people. One year later, the city, which had swollen to about a
                                half-million in population, mostly housed in wooden structures, was again reduced to
                                ashes in the Great Fire of London.
                                In the wake of that inferno, many notable buildings were constructed, including
                                Buckingham Palace and St. Paul’s Cathedral.<br><br>

                                The Bank of England was founded in 1694 and was first governed by Huguenot John Houblon,
                                who helped turn London into an international financial powerhouse. By 1840, the city had
                                swollen to 2 million people, often crowded into unsanitary hovels, which helped create
                                epidemics of cholera and other diseases.<br><br>

                                During the reign of Queen Victoria, London was well established as the prestigious seat
                                of the vast British Empire, and while Big Ben rose above the city in 1859, the London
                                Underground opened in 1863 as the world’s first subterranean railway.
